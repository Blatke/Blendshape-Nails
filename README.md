## How to Add It
Download the .zipmod file of the latest version on the [Release Page](https://github.com/Blatke/Blendshape-Nails/releases).
Drag and drop the file into your **/mods/** folder in your game directory.

Start the **Chara Maker** mode, go to **Female** Chara, and check the **Gloves** tab on **Outfit** panel. Search for "nails" or "blendshape" on the right box, and find two items:
1. **Blendshape Nails Separated** - On Blendshape tab, the nail on each finger is separated.
2. **Blendshape Nails** - On Blendshape tab, the nails are only separated by left and right hands.

Add what you prefer to your character.
Use MaterialEditor to adjust the base color, metaillic and glossiness. If there is a need for customizing the main texture, your can draw patterns on its UV template:

## Adjust It in Studio
Add your character in Studio, select her on the Workspace, open the **advanced mode** of **HS2PE/AIPE**, and switch to the **Blendshape tab** on which you can find some new blendshape blocks added on the left list under the basic chara's blendshapes. (The following screenshot is the chara wearing _Blendshape Nails Separated_, so there are 10 blendshape blocks newly added.)

Click one block on the left list to choose a nail on a finger and move the slider of **Longer** to prolong the nail.

Or **Warp** it somewhat.

Or make it extremly long and warp.

Sometimes the character wears a full-body tight or something else that even the fingers are totally covered. This means these parts of the clothes covering the fingers might clip with the nails.

To prevent this, you can adjust the **Up** slider to move up the nails a little bit along their normal directions. (The following screenshot is the character wearing _Blendshape Nails_ instead of _Blendshape Nails Separated_, so there are merely two blendshape blocks on the left list.)
